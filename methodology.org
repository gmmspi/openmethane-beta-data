* Document Structure
  - will start with an overview as a schematic then perhaps a series
    of descriptions for the components
- Will describe each key point in the process with some suggestions on how we might illustrate it
* Overview of Process
- I imagine a cartoon/schematic for this which I'll try to describe
  - box called Initial estimate, perhaps including a thumbnail map;
    caption: The National Methane Inventory combined with Land Use
    data and other information allows us to produce a map of estimated methane emissions.
  - Arrow leads to box called atmospheric pollution model, we might
    represent it by a weather map with wind arros drawn on it;
    caption: A detailed weather forecast model (WRF) predicts winds which transport methane gas in the
    atmosphere. 
  - Arrow leads to some kind of concentration map; caption: Combining the estimated emissions and an atmospheric pollution model (CMAQ), we generate a
    map of expected atmospheric concentrations of methane - amount of methane in a cubic metre
    of air.
  - Satellite measures a concentration map with the same structure but
    different values (colours?); caption: Satellites can measure the average concentration of methane through the atmosphere.
  - We take the difference between those maps to produce a third map.
    Hot-spots in this difference map drive the alerts; caption: We compare the atmospheric concentrations measured by the satellite with the expected
    atmospheric concentrations produced from the model. These differences will inform corrections
    to the initial emissions estimates. Where these differences are significant, we raise an alert.
  - Arrow leads from this difference map to the atmospheric model
    again, this time with the wind arrows reversed; caption: We can run the atmospheric pollution model backwards to locate the emissions corresponding
    to the concentration differences.
  - Arrow leads back to improved emissions; caption: Corrections produce an improved estimate compared to our initial estimated methane
    emissions.
- Users could perhaps click on any of those boxes to get more information on the steps

* Initial Emissions Estimates
- Show overall emissions with some grid superimposed, emissions should
  not vary within each grid cell to emphasise the importance of
  resolution. Should perhaps have a large point source in it too.
  Caption: We divide Australia into grid squares and calculate the
  average emission in each. The more grid squares we have the more
  detailed our emission maps but the fewer measurements we have to
  estimate each one.
- How do we estimate emissions? Methane comes from many activities
  and noone surveys each grid square to calculate how much comes from
  each activity in each grid square. Instead they accumulate information on how much the
  activity generates in a region (say Australia or a state) then that
  emission is distributed among grid squares. The national estimate for
  each  activity is, itself, indirect. Instead we estimate or count
  the amount of an activity taking place and multiply by how much
  methane is emitted by each unit of activity. This is described by
  the equation $E = fA$ where $E$ is the emission, $A$ the amount of
  the activity and $f$ a factor relating activities and emissions. $f$
  is called an emission factor. Emission factors must be estimated or
  measured at one place and time then applied elsewhere. Incorrect
  emission factors will lead to incorrect emission estimates. This is
  a major source of uncertainty in methane emissions calculated this way. 
- Sometimes we don't have spatial data for the activity we want but
  can measure a good surrogate. For example the amount of fossil fuel
  burnt in a region is calculated by how much is sold to end-users.
  This can be established by sales statistics and is often well known
  but where people use the fossil fuel is not. Previous research _link
  to papers_ has shown fossil fuel use is predicted well by the
  intensity of nighttime lights _link to image_ which are observed by
  satellites. We can spatialize fossil fuel sources from different
  sectors according to the intensity of nighttime lights.
- we need to calculate the level of confidence we have in the
  emissions inventory. This informs the emissions update process (we
  will be more likely to make corrections where we least trust the
  inventory) but also helps us use the data to answer questions like
  the significance of detected trends. Uncertainties in emissions
  come from uncertainties in activity data, emission factors, regional
  totals, the data we use to spatialize them and the assumption that
  our spatial surrogate is accurate for the emissions sector.
  Uncertainties in numbers like emission factors are particularly
  serious since they may bias emissions in  a region rather than a
  single point. We usually express our confidence in an uncertainty,
  expressed as a standard deviation $\sigma$. We calculate the
  uncertainty for each point in the inventory by adding the
  uncertainties from each sector. For mathematical reasons we add the
  squares \[\sigma = \sum_{i=1}^N \sigma_i^2\] where $\sigma_i$ is the
  uncertainty for each sector.
* Atmospheric Pollution Model

* Expected Atmospheric Concentrations
- dataflow starts from global weather observations
- make a detailed forecast guided by global obs, (can we show inset picture)
- Generates wind vectors that move pollutants around in atmosphere 
- Show some image of pollutant concentration, best with a plume starting from the point source in the previous figure. Even better if it can be kind of 3d figure.
* Satellite observations
- Picture of satellite
- Satellite schematic. A bit  like the old slide deck but we'd like to show there's an atmosphere in there and  that we're measuring all through it. For bonus points we could show some kind of plume at the surface caused by an emission and show that we also see all this pollutant higher in the  atmosphere which obscures it
- Some way of showing satellite grid over Earth, perhaps parallel lines with arrows for direction and grid lines across them for along-track sampling
- Impact of clouds etc, adds a cloud mask over previous figure so many grid cells are blanked out
* Alerts
- Apply satellite sampling to pollutant concentration field from model
- Compare with actual satellite obs (so cloud-masked figure from last step)
- Show differences, especially noting hot-spots for alerts
* Emissions Correction
- Show difference plot from alerts step and wind map with arrows reversed
- Arrows leading backwards from high differences to show increased emissions
