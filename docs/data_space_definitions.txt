Spaces definitions

Every 'space' data occupies as it is transformed through the model is defined as a python class.
these classes are divided into 2 types: interface and extractable data

-interface data is for passing information from one transformation to another.
It has no explicit requirements to its structure and can store information in whatever form is most convienent.
(e.g: list of filenames, python dictionary, numpy matrix, etc.)

-extractable data must contain a dataset of single elements in an ordered list / vector.
It has the get_vector method for extracting an attribute from the single elements as a python list
and can also store metadata related to the list as a whole.
(e.g: for a set of observations: the set has descriptions of the instrument used and the domain and each observation stores the measured value, location/time and associated error)


These space are:

PhysicalData (interface)
-representation of the dataset you are trying to optimize for.
-is constructed as the background / prior estimate for the minimizer and from the UnknownData
-is converted into UnknownData and ModelInputData
(e.g: model parameters)

UnknownData (extractable):
-the vector form of PhysicalData
-is already pre-conditioned (if applicable)
-is run through the minimizer
-is constructed from and converted into PhysicalData

ModelInputData (interface)
-the required input for the forward model to run
-is constructed from PhysicalData and converted into ModelOutputData
(e.g: a list of filenames used by the forward model)

ModelOutputData (interface)
-the output of the forward model
-is constructed from ModelInputData and converted into ObservationData

ObservationData (extractable)
-the set of observations either from measurements or simulated from the model
-is constructed from ModelOutputData (observation operator) and as the observed data (from file)
-is converted into residuals (also ObservationData) and AdjointForcingData

AdjointForcingData (interface)
-the input of the adjoint model
-is constructed from the weighted residuals of ObservationData
-is converted into SensitivityData

SensitivityData (interface)
-the output of the adjoint model
-is constructed from AdjointForcingData
-is converted into UnknownData (as a gradient)
