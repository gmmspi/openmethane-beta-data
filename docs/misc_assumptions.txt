-Physical Data timestep must be cleanly divisible into a day
(No. seconds per day) % (No. seconds per timestep) == 0

-cmaq emission timestep (defined in data/templates/emis_template.ncf)
must be cleanly divisible into a day

-cmaq emission timestep must be cleanly divisible into a Physical Data timestep

-emis template file must have TSTEP dimension of length equal to No. timesteps per day.
(eg: with 1hr timestep, len(TSTEP) == 24)

-len(physical.emis[time]) == No. days * steps per day (eg 1hr, 4days = len of 96)

-dimension order is always (TIME, LAYER, ROW, COLUMN) (where applicable)
