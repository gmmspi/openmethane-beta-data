the tests package has 3 subpackages included.

Skeleton:
This is mine. Testing for the framework during development. users should not need this.

Function:
This is for auto-testing user-required code.
It tests all the user-definied components that are required by the framework to run.
All these tests should be pre-defined and will not require user modification to run.
These tests are accessed by the tests/check_error.py file, where user-parameters are set and the functions are run.
output is a summary pass/fail list for every test run and a traceback for any failed test.
outputs can be send to a file, the screen, or supressed by the params in check_error

Accuracy:
This is to assess the internal consistency of components.
Tests in here output reports instead of a simple pass/fail check.
e.g: does a calculated gradient produce a similar answer to a finite difference perturbation?
