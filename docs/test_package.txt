the tests package has 3 subpackages included.

Skeleton:
This is mine. Testing for the framework during development. users should not need this.

Function:
This is for auto-testing user-required code.
config_function_test.py holds the config for the user for a test run,
whether to run the test or not, any setup requirements and any teardown requirements are defined here
run the function test by calling > python run_function_test.py

Accuracy:
This is to assess the internal consistency of components.
Tests in here output reports instead of a simple pass/fail check.
e.g: does a calculated gradient produce a similar answer to a finite difference perturbation?
