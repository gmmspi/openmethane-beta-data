note that tropomi reoslution changed to  5.5km along track on 6 august
2019 though this was not noted yet in resolution flag [[file:~/work/openmethane-beta/tropomi/tropomi-performance.pdf]]
Mainland Australia and Tasmania extend approximately from latitude –10.6 deg N (Cape
York, Queensland) to –43.6 deg N (South-east Cape, Tasmania), and longitude 113.2 deg E
(Steep Point, Western Australia) to 153.6 deg E (Cape Byron, NSW).

Notes on ATBD
P17 0.8% precision and 0.25 percent inter-region bias
P17 3% of data is cloud free
P19 36 layers equidistant in pressure
start with CH4 and CO from TM5 and H2O and tmp from ECMWF
P19 they make an explicit dry air correction
P25 they use 12 layers in their state vector
P25 they give a priori values, yes!
P26 Phillips-Tikhonov regularization scheme
P27 note Eqs 45 and 46
P28 VIIRS cloud clearing
P29 they bias-correct based on albedo
P31 the new bias correction redeuces station-station variability of the bias by 5.6ppb  and reduces albedo-dependent biases by 13.6 ppb, reduces scatter of GOSAT comparison by 4ppb
P31  since version 2.3.1 oc glint measurements included, note the correction factor of about 0.3% (note eq 54 for sunglint angle)
P31 since retrieval version 2.4.0 there's a spectral dependence of albedo note the release date of May 30 2022 so should  be operational before July 2022
